# Project 2: Sensor Fusion and Object Detection

- Write a short recap of the four tracking steps and what you implemented there (EKF, track management, data association, camera-lidar sensor fusion). Which results did you achieve? Which part of the project was most difficult for you to complete, and why?
- Do you see any benefits in camera-lidar fusion compared to lidar-only tracking (in theory and in your concrete results)?
- Which challenges will a sensor fusion system face in real-life scenarios? Did you see any of these challenges in the project?
- Can you think of ways to improve your tracking results in the future?

## Step 1: Extended Kalman Filter `filter.py` 

In this step, an extended kalman filter is implemented using the measurements from a 3D lidar detection. This uses a kinematic model for motion prediction.        

## Step 4:
